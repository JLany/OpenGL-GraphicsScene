## Introduction

This project represents the culmination of extensive effort and dedication to creating a robust and visually impressive graphics scene. It covers fundamental and advanced aspects of OpenGL, including lighting, shading, texture mapping, and more. The aim is to provide a comprehensive example that can serve as a reference for anyone interested in OpenGL graphics programming.

## Features

- **Realistic Lighting Models**: Implementations of ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.
- **Texture Mapping**: Application of textures to 3D models to enhance visual fidelity.
- **Advanced Shading**: Use of vertex and fragment shaders for fine-grained control over rendering.
- **Camera Control**: Interactive camera manipulation to navigate through the scene.
- **Object Transformations**: Scaling, rotation, and translation of objects within the scene.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Techniques to ensure smooth and efficient rendering.

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/JLany/OpenGL-GraphicsScene.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd OpenGL-GraphicsScene
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
    Ensure you have the necessary libraries and tools installed, such as GLFW and GLAD. You can typically install these via package managers or download them directly.

4. **Build the project**:
    Depending on your development environment, you might use a build system like CMake or directly compile using GCC/Clang.
    ```sh
    cmake .
    make
    ```

## Usage

Once the project is built, you can run the executable to launch the graphics scene. Use the following controls to interact with the scene:

- **W/A/S/D**: Move the camera forward, left, backward, and right.
- **Mouse Movement**: Rotate the camera.
- **Q/E**: Move the camera up and down.
- **Esc**: Exit the application.

Experiment with different views and appreciate the intricate details implemented in the scene.
